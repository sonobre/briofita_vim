=== Installation and Use

You can install Briofita by dowloading it as a Zip file (either from
the Vim.org site or from Github).

Unpack it in the appropriate
place under your .vim (_vim) directory.

One usual place is the "bundle" directory: the Pathogen plugin makes it
easy to enable or disable bundle plugins.

Another way it can be installed in by placing it in the "pack" directory,
managed by Vim itself. In the "pack/start" subdirectory the colorscheme
becomes available from the Vim startup time. In "pack/opt" subdirectory
you will need to first run ":packadd" to make it available.

Installation can be done, too, is by cloning Briofita git repository from github.

Once installed the colorscheme it can be used like any other colorscheme.
For example, use below command:

------
:color briofita
------
