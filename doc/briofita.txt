ABOUT BRIOFITA                                           *briofita-about* [[[1


`Briofita` can be downloaded from

        http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4136
	
(Vim online page)

        or from

https://github.com/sonobre/briofita_vim

(Github repo).

Briofita (the name is pronounced like 'Bryophyta') is a Vim colorscheme.
It uses high contrast wherever it benefits text legibility. Priority is given
to user's visual comfort within each filetype editing session.

The colorscheme fits study, research and work needs. (It is not
recommended to color blinded people: it has elements highlighted in red.)

Due to the unusually high number of syntax highlights it implements this is
NOT a minimalist colorscheme, and it is not recommended for use in systems
which are low in memory or have older CPUs, a limitation that is likely going
to be short-lived given the current pace of changes in processor or memory
technology...

Feedback~

All colorscheme syntaxes present in Briofita have been custom-designed and tested.

But it has so MANY highlights that, for sure, it still can be improved a lot.

Feedbacks are welcome! In case you send an e-mail please prepend [VIM] in the subject
title for it not be regarded as spam.

History~

Originally this colorscheme was just a tweaked version of `Moss`, a vimscript
by Chunlin Lin, with few changes for personal preferences. You can install Moss
per below link from Vim site:

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2779

Along the time Briofita got many changes inspired by other favorite
colorschemes; for example, one of the early Briofita versions used an adaptation
of the color dictionary found in Distinguished, a colorshcheme by Kim SilkebÃ¦kken.

Vim Version~

Since Briofita version 4.0.0 (released in 2017) this colorscheme requires 
Vim version 8 or higher.

Operating Systems~

There is no operating-system specific command in the colorscheme.
It should be `fully` functional under any system that Vim supports.
Author's most used operating system are GNU/Linux distros.

Terminals~

The author uses this colorscheme both on Vim GUI and under the Gnome Terminal. 
Other terminals are not currently available to the author for testing.

User feedback on how the colorscheme behaves on other terminals will be
highly appreciated.

                                                                  |briofita-TOC|

==============================================================================

INSTALLATION                                       *briofita-installation*  [[[1


Briofita can be downloaded from the Vim online site or from github.

From Vim site the colorscheme is downloaded as a packed file (zip).

From Github Briofita can be downloaded as a packed Zip file or by cloning
its git repository.

Briofita repository URL:

https://github.com/sonobre/briofita_vim

MANUAL INSTALLATION FOR NON-PATHOGEN USERS

Unpack the zip file and move the uncompressed sub-diretories' contents ("colors",
for example) into the corresponding directories of your ".vim" directory.
And do :helptags.

MANUAL INSTALLATION FOR PATHOGEN USERS

In case you use Pathogen (or similar bundle-based plugins) create a
".vim/bundle/briofita" directory and move the directory tree of the
unpacked file into it. (If you do not want the plugin, just delete the "plugin"
directory from the unzipped directory tree.)
Proceed by doing ":Helptags".

Another way of installing it: unzip it into the "pack/start" dir.

If you want the colorscheme started at Vim start-up put the above command
in your "*vimrc" file.

Partial Installation~

The colorscheme can be executed independently of the companion items (helpfile, etc.).

You may PARTIALLY INSTALL it.

For example if you want the colorscheme but not
the helpfile: >
	Do not copy the "doc" dir when installing it.
	Or, if already copied, just delete the "doc" directory.
<

Usage~

After the colorscheme has been correctly installed, jus open a Vim instance
and execute the following command:
>
			:color briofita
<

Uninstallation~
To uninstall Briofita, just delete the above sources from the "colors" and "doc"
directories. And run again :helptags (or :Helptags).

                                                                  |briofita-TOC|

PERFORMANCE                                         *briofita-performance*  [[[1

General Performance~

This colorscheme has a LOT of syntax groups. If you think the colorscheme
has had any performace impact on your system please inform the author via 
email or via Github issue.

Dropped Features~

Until version 3.1.0 (released on Vim.Org site on March, 2014) Briofita had
some customization options and a complex "highlight cycling" feature. All
this was dropped in version 4.0.0 for the sake of simplicity and maintenability.

(Some of these features will be forwarded to a new colorscheme now in the works.)

                                                                  |briofita-TOC|

ISSUES                                             *briofita-known-issues*  [[[1

Cleared Highlights~

When more than one highlight definition sources is simultaneously active
(colorschemes and syntax files, for example, in different tabpages) an item
may sometimes have its color cleared. View the below URL from Stackoverflow,
about this topic:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12915797/gvim-remove-syntax-highlighting-groups/16630011#16630011

Briofita tries to minimize the use of highlight link commands in connection with
the avoidance of cleared highlights.


High Contrast~

Some syntax elements may be shown in HIGH CONTRAST: for example HelpBar or
HelpStar (when not hidden per Conceal attribute).
